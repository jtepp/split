> A simple way to keep track of split bills

The idea behind this app was concieved while I was with my friends and one asked "how are we going to split bills for dinner and groceries when we live together?"
I responded "I don't know, but I could probably make an app pretty quickly."

Four days later and here I am, writing this readme with a completed iOS app.
